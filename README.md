# Ultra Marathon Data Cleaning & Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **data cleaning and analysis** of ultra marathon running statistics using Python. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggleâ€™s Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/data), contains information on thousands of races and runners worldwide. The workflow includes cleaning the raw data to handle inconsistencies and missing values, followed by exploratory analysis to uncover trends in performance, participation, and demographics. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to process large-scale sports data and extract meaningful insights from endurance race statistics.
