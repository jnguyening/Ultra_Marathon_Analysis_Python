# Ultra Marathon Data Cleaning & Analysis

## Overview

This project delivers a deep-dive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global ultra-marathon race results, processing a massive raw dataset of over 7 million records spanning from 1798 to 2022. Using Python and the Pandas library, the analysis narrows this vast history down to a high-impact subset—specifically 50km and 100km races in the USA during 2020—to uncover the variables that drive peak human endurance.

The workflow is designed to showcase the full data science lifecycle, from handling "big data" memory constraints to generating boardroom-ready visualizations. By cleaning non-standardized string data and engineering new demographic features, the project provides a data-backed look at how age, gender, and seasonality influence athlete performance in one of the world's most grueling sports.
