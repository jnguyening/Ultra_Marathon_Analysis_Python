#  Ultra Marathon Running Data Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

This project performs **data analysis** on ultra marathon race statistics using Python. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle’s Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/data), contains detailed records on runners, races, distances, and finish times. The analysis explores performance trends, participation patterns, and the impact of various factors such as gender, age, and race type. This project showcases how Python can be used to uncover insights from endurance sports data through cleaning, visualization, and exploratory techniques.
